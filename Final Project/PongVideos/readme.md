# Pong Game Videos

This directory contains a collection of videos showing the training process of an agent playing the Pong game using deep reinforcement learning. The agent was trained using the algorithm described in the "Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning" article by the DeepMind team of Google.

The videos are named in the format of "openaigym.video.0.11628.video(X).mp4", where X represents the episode number. Each video shows the agent playing a full game of Pong, and the agent's performance improves as the episode number increases. The agent starts off making random moves, but as it learns from its experiences, it becomes better at playing the game and scores more points.

These videos can be used to visualize the agent's learning process and understand how the algorithm works. They can also be used as a reference for anyone who wants to replicate the training process and build their own agent to play Pong.

Note that the videos were recorded at a lower frame rate than the actual game to reduce the file size, and the agent's performance may appear better than it actually is due to this.

You can use any video player to watch these videos.
