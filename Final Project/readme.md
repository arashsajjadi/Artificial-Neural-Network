# RL-CNN Pong Game Agent

This repository contains a project that implements the concepts of deep reinforcement learning (RL) using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the game Pong. The project is based on the paper "Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning" (cited by 10,853) published in 2013. The goal of the project is to train an RL agent that can learn to play Pong by watching a video of the game and interacting with the environment.
## Getting Started

The project is implemented in Python and requires the following packages to be installed:

   - Pytorch
   - Numpy
   - Matplotlib
   - Gym

To run the project, simply execute the main.py file. The script will automatically train the agent and display the results in the form of a video.
Additional Resources

In addition to the "Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning" paper, the following resources were used in the implementation of this project:

   1. "Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning" (cited by 22,480) published in 2015
   2. "Deep Reinforcement Learning with Double Q-Learning" (cited by 6,220) published in 2016
   3. "Dueling Network Architectures for Deep Reinforcement Learning" (cited by 3,316) published in 2016

A table listing these resources and their citation count is included at the end of this README.
## Functionalities

The code includes a number of functionalities such as the ability to:

   - Save and resume training
   - Change the frequency of target network updates
   - Use double DQN
