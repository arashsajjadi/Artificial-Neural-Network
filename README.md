# Artificial-Neural-Network

## Assignments
I passed the Artificial Neural Network course at Shahid Beheshti University under the supervision of Dr. Khard Pisheh, a computer science faculty member of Shahid Beheshti University. You can access all my activities during the course in this repository.

## Final Project: Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning

In this project, I trained an agent to play the classic game of Pong using deep reinforcement learning. The algorithm used is based on the "Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning" article by the DeepMind team of Google. I used Pytorch, numpy, matplotlib and gym to implement the project.

The agent starts off making random moves, but as it learns from its experiences, it becomes better at playing the game and scores more points. I recorded a collection of videos of the agent playing the Pong game during the training process which can be found in the [Pong Game Videos](https://github.com/arashsajjadi/Artificial-Neural-Network/tree/main/Final%20Project/PongVideos) directory.

If you want to replicate the training process or build your own agent, you can find the code and the results graph in the [Final Project](https://github.com/arashsajjadi/Artificial-Neural-Network/tree/main/Final%20Project) directory.

This project was my final project of Artificial Neural Networks course presented by Prof. SaeedReza Kheradpisheh at Shahid Beheshti University, and I completed it as a master's student in data science.
